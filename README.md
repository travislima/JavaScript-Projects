# JavaScript Projects

Started 06 March 2018

Part of my Frontend Developer Journery. This is me "learning by building". 

This repository is dedicated to all of my JavaScript Projects that I am making (or at least, building via tutorials). JS, is a huge part of any Frontend Developers skillset and it is very important for the future of WordPress (React).

I will update this repo with a numbered folder, inside the folder will have all the respective files that makes up that project.

Project #2 - CSS JS Clock (12 March 2018)

Great tutorial, feel like I am able to read JS a lot better and understand things. Learn by building is really they way forward. I had some pretty intense Troubleshooting to do with my code (minor syntax error) but in the end got it working and changed up the styling a bit. Getting there. But not really on a once per day kind of level. Too many things I am focusing on, will see if it is a good or bad thing. Only time will tell.

Great course!


This is the FREE tutorial I am following (video JavaScript FREE Gold - thanks Wes Bos!): https://javascript30.com/
