# JavaScript Projects - 6 March 2018

==========================================================================
Part of my Frontend Developer Journery. This is me "learn by building". 
==========================================================================

This repository is dedicated to all of my JavaScript Projects that I am making (or at least, building via tutorials). JS, is a huge part of any Frontend Developers skillset and it is very important for the future of WordPress (React).

I will update this repo with a numbered folder, inside the folder will have all the respective files that makes up that project.

=========================================
Project #1 - JS Drum Kit (06 March 2018)	

Great start. First time watching a Wes Bos tutorial, very clear and easy to understand. I managed to grasp what was taught, but will need more practice if I am to replicate this out of my head completely.	
 	 
Feeling excited and positive!

=========================================
Project #2 - CSS JS Clock (12 March 2018)

Great tutorial, feel like I am able to read JS a lot better and understand things. Learn by building is really they way forward. I had some pretty intense Troubleshooting to do with my code (minor syntax error) but in the end got it working and changed up the styling a bit. Getting there. But not really on a once per day kind of level. Too many things I am focusing on, will see if it is a good or bad thing. Only time will tell.

Great course!

=========================================
Project #3 - Coming Soon (TBA)
