# JavaScript Projects

Started 06 March 2018

Part of my Frontend Developer Journery. This is me "learning by building". 

This repository is dedicated to all of my JavaScript Projects that I am making (or at least, building via tutorials). JS, is a huge part of any Frontend Developers skillset and it is very important for the future of WordPress (React).

I will update this repo with a numbered folder, inside the folder will have all the respective files that makes up that project.

This is the FREE tutorial I am following (video JavaScript FREE Gold - thanks Wes Bos!): https://javascript30.com/

Project #1 - JS Drum Kit (06 March 2018)

Great start. First time watching a Wes Bos tutorial, very clear and easy to understand. I managed to grasp what was taught, but will need more practice if I am to replicate this out of my head completely.

Feeling excited and positive!
